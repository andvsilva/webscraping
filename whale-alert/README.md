# On Chain Analysis for blockchain data using the Whale Alert API framework in python.

A marvelous tutorial showing a simple example of how to implement On Chain Analysis for one specific metric called Inflow and Outflow transactions of BTC to exchanges using the [Whale Alert API](https://docs.whale-alert.io/#introduction). In the market is a consensus that this metric shows a correlation with the price of BTC. I am not an expert in On Chain Analysis, this one way to work around with topic and to study more about.

```
I strong recomend NOT to use this tutorial to make an investiment decision, 
and the proposal of this example is to study the topic only.

Hi, I am a Bitcoin enthusiastic and maximalist (almost 99%) and since 2017 I started reading and studying about the crypto market, and now I still reading and studying more and more about it, because I believe that what Bitcoin did for the first time in human history. Below the best description that I see so far about Bitcoin:

![](images/btc_fundamentals.png)
<!--
```bash
In 2008 a person or group of people using pseudonym
Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a decentralized peer-to-peer system 
for making and processing payments a key challenge in digital 
payments is to prevent the same assets from being spent twice 
the bitcoin white paper proposed a novel method for validating 
transactions using crytography that address the so-called double 
spend problem this and other innovations related to distributed 
ledger technology are the foundation for based digital assets.
```
-->

In this article I will explain and show how to use the [Whale Alert API](https://docs.whale-alert.io/#introduction) to track historical transaction data and to make your own analysis from differents blockchains, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and others, for more information read the documentation [Whale Alert API](https://docs.whale-alert.io/#introduction).

In this implementation I will focus **On Chain Analysis** of the BTC blockchain transaction data to look deep dive into **the metric Inflow and Outflow of BTCs**:

- ```from exchange to unknown(wallet)```
- ```from exchange to exchange```
- ```from unknown to exchange```
- ```from unknown(wallet) to unknown(wallet)```

This metric shows a correlation with the price of BTC, because more BTCs flowing to the exchanges, there are a high probability that these BTCs can be sold in the market, i.e. a high strong BTC sales pressure making the price go down, and by the contrary, we expect the price go up, because a high flow of BTCs are going out from exchange to unknown(wallet):

In Summary for this article, I will describe how to build the framework(Using one python package avaliable) to get the data and to make the analysis:

- [Build the API using the Whale Alert framework to get BTC blockchain transaction data]().
- [Analysis the data, making plots to compare the Inflow and Outflow of BTCs and search one way to quantify a correlation with the price]().
